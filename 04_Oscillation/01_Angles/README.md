# 01 Angles - Radians and Degrees
In Maths back in school we expressed angles in terms of degrees. For instance a right angle triangle has one side which is 90 degrees. However a computer doesn't compute in degrees but rather in radians.
### Definition
A radian is a unit of measurement for angles defined by the ratio of the length of the arc of a circle to the radius of that circle.

The formula to convert from degrees to radians is:
```
radians = 2 * PI * (degrees / 360)
```
## Notes
- limit() function limits the magnitude of a vector
- constrain() function constrains a value between a minimum or maximum value
