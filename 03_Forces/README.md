Definitions:
- A force is a vector that causes an object with mass to accelerate.
- Newton's First Law - An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion at a constant speed and direction unless acted upon by and unbalanced force.
- Newton's Third Law - For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.
- Forces always occurs in pairs. The two forces are of equal strength, but in opposite directions.
- Newton's Second Law - Force equals mass times acceleration.
