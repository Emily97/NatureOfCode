# Vectors08 - Normalizing Vectors
In this tutorial we are learning about normalizing vectors. Normalizing means we can make the length of the vector a fixed or standard length. By fixing the length of the vector to 1 we create what is known as a unit vector. The vectors length will always be constant i.e. it will not change length no matter what direction the line is pointing to.

## Code
The setup for this question is the same as previous questions please refer back to them are copy the code from the previous exercise.
The new lines of code in this exercise change the length of the vectorLine to 1 which is the unit vector. This is the multiplied in this case by 50 so that the line can be seen.
```js
vectorLine.normalize();
vectorLine.mult(50);
```
